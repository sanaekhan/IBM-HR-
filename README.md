Attrition Rate: ~16.1% of employees left the company

Age: Higher attrition observed among younger employees

Gender: Minor differences in attrition rate

Department: Sales and HR had the highest turnover

Income: Lower income groups are more prone to attrition

OverTime: Strong correlation with attrition
